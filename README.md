# hateoas-demo
This POC project ought to address a "how-to guide" which provides aid to developers to integrate different client implementations with a hateoas backend.
Both generated and hand-written endpoints are created in the backend project.
On the client side, there are three different implementations which are :
* feign (generated)
* restTemplate
* traverson
